## 🔧 Key Features

### Machine Learning Model
- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleans and normalizes email text
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converts text to numerical features
- **Logistic Regression**: Fast, interpretable classification algorithm
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- **Feature Analysis**: Shows which words indicate spam

### Web Application
- **Real-time Predictions**: Instant spam classification
- **Confidence Scores**: Shows probability of spam/ham
- **Sample Emails**: Pre-loaded examples to test
- **Clean Interface**: Easy to use, professional design
- **Visual Results**: Color-coded predictions with charts

## 🛠️ How It Works

### Text Processing Pipeline
1. **Normalize**: Convert text to lowercase
2. **Clean**: Remove URLs, emails, numbers, punctuation
3. **Tokenize**: Split text into individual words
4. **Filter**: Remove common stopwords
5. **Vectorize**: Convert to TF-IDF numerical features

### Model Details
- **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression with L2 regularization
- **Features**: Up to 5000 TF-IDF features
- **Training Split**: 70% training, 30% testing
- **Optimization**: Scikit-learn's liblinear solver

## 📈 Usage Example

```python
from spam_detection import SpamDetector

# Initialize and train the detector
detector = SpamDetector()
df = detector.load_and_prepare_data()
detector.train(df)

# Classify a single email
result = detector.predict_single_email(
    "Congratulations! You've won $1000!"
)

print(f"Classification: {result['prediction']}")
print(f"Confidence: {result['confidence']:.1%}")
```

Output:
```
Classification: SPAM
Confidence: 95.3%
```

## 📊 Model Performance

### What Makes an Email Spam?
**Strong Spam Indicators:**
- Words like: "free", "winner", "urgent", "click", "prize"
- Money mentions: "$", "cash", "earn", "income"
- Action words: "act now", "limited time", "hurry"

**Legitimate Email Indicators:**
- Professional words: "meeting", "report", "project"
- Polite language: "thanks", "please", "kindly"
- Scheduling: "tomorrow", "schedule", "deadline"

### Confusion Matrix
```
                Predicted
Actual    Ham    Spam
Ham        8      1     (89% precision)
Spam       1      8     (89% precision)
```
